# Key Features

* Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
The dashboard prominently displays essential metrics such as total sales, total profit, total units sold, total number of products, total number of customers, and total orders. These KPIs provide a snapshot of the company's sales performance.

* Doughnut Charts:
The dashboard includes four interactive doughnut charts that offer insights into different aspects of sales. These charts depict the distribution of orders by ship mode, sales by category, top 5 states by sales, and top 5 cities by sales. This information helps identify trends, preferences, and opportunities for targeted strategies.

* Sales Trend Column Chart:
The main sales trend column chart illustrates the overall sales trend over time, specifically by quarter. It highlights the upward trend, indicating consistent growth in sales. The chart also enables a deeper analysis of individual sales figures for countries, states, and cities.

* Map Chart:
A map chart is incorporated to provide a geographic perspective on sales. It visually represents sales data across different regions, allowing stakeholders to identify regional strengths and opportunities for expansion.
